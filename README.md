# URL-shortening-service

Designing a simple URL shortening service involves creating a system that takes long URLs as input, generates a short alias for them, and stores the mapping between the short alias and the original URL. When a user accesses the short alias, the system redirects them to the corresponding original URL.
Before ,i am going to design a solution,i will list the six things that will give an idea to design a url shortening solution.

1.Requirements 

2.Traffic

3.URL Length

4.Data capacity modeling

5.URL Shortening Logic

6.Database

Here's a high-level explanation of how we can design a basic URL shortening service, along with a code example in Java:

Data Structure:
We need a data structure to store the mappings between short aliases and original URLs. For simplicity, we can use a HashMap to store this information in memory. In a real-world scenario, a persistent storage solution like a database should be used.

URL Shortening Algorithm:
We can use various methods to generate short aliases. One simple approach is to generate a random alphanumeric string of a fixed length. Alternatively, we can use a hash function (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) to generate a fixed-length hash from the original URL.

API Endpoints:
We need two API endpoints: one to receive a long URL and return a short alias, and another to handle requests to access the short alias and redirect to the original URL.
Let's implement a basic URL shortening service using Java:
